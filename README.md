# Budget Tracker

This application is a simple budget tracker, which allows users to keep track of their transactions so they know how much money they still have to work with. Using a service worker and IndexedDB, this app allows users to make changes regardless of changes to internet connection. There are still a few bugs to be worked out, but those will all be resolved in future updates.
